# Survey Me App

Survey Me it's finally here. A web application for curious people who like to share their preferences with the rest of the world.

With the kind sponsorship of [Bliss Applications](http://www.bliss.pt/) and the helpful skeleton of [angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed), Survey Me could finally see daylight. You'll most certainly be amazed by the easiness of answering polls, checking people's preferences or even sharing all this with your friends. You'll get started right away, just follow this steps below:


## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the Survey Me repository and install the dependencies:

### Prerequisites

You need git to clone the Survey repository. You can get git from
[http://git-scm.com/](http://git-scm.com/).

We also use a number of node.js tools to initialize SurveyMe. You must have node.js and
its package manager (npm) installed.  You can get them from [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/).

### Clone angular-seed

First, you'll want to clone the SurveyMe repository using [git], so you can have it on your computer:

```
git clone https://github.com/tiagocovas/surveyMe.git

```
All righty, you have it on your computer. Now let's move to the folder we've just created.

```
cd surveyMe
```
And now, we're ready to start installing dependencies.

### Install Dependencies

We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and angular framework code.  The tools help
us manage and test the application.

`npm` is preconfigured to automatically run `bower` so we can simply do:

```
npm install
```

### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server.  The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now just browse to the app at `http://localhost:8000/`. Pretty good, ain't it?
